# Classical_Planning_of_Actions_for_DWR_Domain

As a part of my research on online planning for intelligent agents to operate autonomously, I implemented this project as a pilot project to test the suitability of MATLAB for planning problems.

I described a sample Dock-Worker robot domain in MATLAB using object-oriented programming based on PDDL planning formalism and first-order logic. A forward search algorithm with a breadth-first strategy is developed as the planner to design an action plan for a given initial and goal states. The planner also gives out the expectation of the system state after the application of each action in the action plan
